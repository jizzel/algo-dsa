## Getting Started

### Fork the Repository

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account by clicking the "Fork" button at the top right of this page.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd repo-name
   ```

### Set Up Your Local Environment

Ensure that you have the necessary tools installed to run the LeetCode solutions in your language of choice.

- **Python:** Set up a virtual environment and install required dependencies:
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- **Java:** Make sure you have JDK installed and set up on your system. You may use an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code with Java extensions.

## How to Contribute

### Adding a New Solution

1. **Create a new branch**: 
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/new-solution
   ```

2. **Write the code**:
   - Follow the existing directory structure:
     - Place Python solutions in the `python/` directory.
     - Place Java solutions in the `java/` directory.
   - Name the file according to the problem ID and title (e.g., `0020-valid-parentheses.py` for Python or `Solution0020.java` for Java).

3. **Add test cases**:
   - Include test cases in the same file (for simplicity) or in a dedicated `tests/` directory.

4. **Commit your changes**:
   - Write clear and concise commit messages:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add solution for LeetCode 0020: Valid Parentheses"
   ```

5. **Push your branch**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/new-solution
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Go to the repository on GitHub, and youâ€™ll see an option to create a Pull Request (PR).
   - Fill in the PR template, including details about the problem solved, the approach used, and any other relevant information.

### Updating an Existing Solution

1. Follow the same steps as adding a new solution, but instead of creating a new file, modify the existing one.
2. Clearly describe what changes you made and why in the commit message and PR description.

## Code Style

- **Python:**
  - Use descriptive variable names.
  - Add comments to explain the logic and steps in your code.
  - Ensure your code is PEP8 compliant.
  - Maintain consistency with existing Python code in the repository.

- **Java:**
  - Follow Java naming conventions (e.g., `camelCase` for variables, `PascalCase` for classes).
  - Add comments to explain the logic and steps in your code.
  - Ensure your code is formatted properly and follows the standard Java coding conventions.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure that your code passes all tests before submitting the PR.
2. Fill out the PR template completely and accurately.
3. Await review from project maintainers. They might request changes or provide feedback.
4. Once your PR is approved, it will be merged into the main branch.
