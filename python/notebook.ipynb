    "# Leetcode Daily Coding Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the **Leetcode Daily Coding Solutions** notebook! This notebook serves as a comprehensive tracker and repository of the Python solutions to various coding problems my friend and I solve daily on Leetcode.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to document our progress as we tackle Leetcode problems, systematically improving our problem-solving skills, and reinforcing our understanding of key algorithms and data structures. By keeping a record of each problem we solve, along with detailed explanations, we aim to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Track Progress:** Monitor our daily coding journey and visualize the growth in our problem-solving abilities.\n",
    "- **Consolidate Knowledge:** Develop a deeper understanding of various coding techniques, algorithms, and data structures by documenting and reviewing each solution.\n",
    "- **Enhance Collaboration:** Facilitate discussions and code reviews, allowing us to learn from each other's approaches and insights.\n",
    "- **Serve as a Reference:** Create a personal code library that can be referred to in the future for quick refreshers or interviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contents\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is structured to include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Problem Statement:** A clear description of the problem, including any relevant constraints and example inputs/outputs.\n",
    "- **Solution Approach:** An outline of the thought process and algorithm used to solve the problem.\n",
    "- **Python Code:** The implementation of the solution in Python, following best coding practices.\n",
    "- **Complexity Analysis:** A brief analysis of the time and space complexity of the solution.\n",
    "- **Alternate Approaches:** (If applicable) Exploration of different ways to solve the problem, comparing their efficiency and readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Each problem is organized by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Date Solved:** The date on which the problem was solved.\n",
    "2. **Problem Category:** The type of problem (e.g., arrays, strings, dynamic programming).\n",
    "3. **Solution Code:** The Python code implementation of the solution.\n",
    "4. **Notes and Observations:** Any additional notes, insights, or learnings from solving the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Expand Problem Coverage:** Continue solving a wide range of problems to cover different categories and difficulty levels.\n",
    "- **Optimize Solutions:** Revisit past solutions to improve efficiency and explore alternative algorithms.\n",
    "- **Collaborative Growth:** Engage in regular code reviews with my friend to provide constructive feedback and learn from each otherâ€™s approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are excited to continue this journey of daily coding practice and self-improvement. Feel free to explore the notebook and follow along with our progress!\n"
